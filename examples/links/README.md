# Routing/Links Example

There are 3 routes in this example.

2 Normal Routes:

- [`/`](src/routes/index.tsx)
- [`/other/`](src/routes/other.tsx)

1 User Defined Route:

- [`/user/`](src/userDefinedRoutes.d.ts)

Normal Routes: Automatically generated routes based on the Components defined in `src/routes`
User Defined Routes: Routes that are expected to be valid local routes, but aren't learned by the Normal Routes generation process
